    <article class="poem">
That yellowing notebook that holds half-finished titles and phrases never completed:  
the novel stopped just shy of its first page, the sketch of a project waiting only for a touch of color.  
The crumpled map of lands never explored, the ticket to a concert that no longer has a voice.  
The score of a song whistled at dawn, its notes hanging between desire and the fear of not trying.  

For too long we piled these relics in the drawer of memory,  
labeling them “maybe someday” or “postponed indefinitely.”  
But every shelved dream becomes a faded echo, a heartbeat losing strength in the silence.  

Now enough with letting our sparks rot away:  
open that notebook, blow off the dust, hear the pages creak begging to be turned.  
Pick up the pen, reignite the act of creation:  
one word after another, one stroke after another, restore breath to your dreams.  

No decree is needed nor a champion’s sweeping move:  
just the determination in a daily gesture.  
Book that trip with a simple act of courage,  
plot a route on a fresh map, feel the wind on your cheeks.  
Write the first line of that novel at six in the morning,  
when the world still hangs between darkness and light.  
Launch that garage idea workshop,  
let a sketch become a prototype, then earn your first feedback.  

Every choice is a step out of the queue of regrets.  
Every action fills the void left by hesitation.  
Thus, dream by dream, project by project,  
we transform the ghosts of waiting into living beings:  
breathing, vulnerable, ready to smile.  

Because a dream is not a distant echo to file away,  
but a vital impulse demanding its moment.  
And true victory does not lie in waiting for universal applause,  
but in the strength to return, each day, to our blank page.
