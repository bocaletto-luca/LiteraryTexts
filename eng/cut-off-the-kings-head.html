    <article class="poem">
Have you ever heard of the King?  
He does not wear a golden crown,  
but a tie of steel  
and sits on piles of banknotes.  

He speaks of democracy  
with a mouth full of laws penned by his advisors,  
while you decide your daily bread  
with the cold calculus of those who count only profits.  

His army?  
Mayors, managers, obedient journalists,  
and a parade of promises never kept.  

His wealth?  
It is not in palaces, but in our silences  
and the taxes we pay to keep him upright.  

But what would happen  
if we proved that his head  
is no longer an inviolable throne?  
If we took hold  
of the shears of indignation  
and severed that whim of power?  

Imagine a day  
when every citizen stands,  
not to elect a new scepter,  
but to break the chain  
of a privilege long stale.  

“Cut off the King’s head”  
is a symbolic gesture  
to free lost dignity,  
to bring sovereignty  
from those silent rooms  
to the beating heart of the square.  

It doesn’t require blood,  
only the truth shouted in chorus:  
“We are power!”  
“We are the voice that counts!”  

And when the King falls,  
we will not elect another like him,  
but discover that power  
lives within each of us:  
in the decision to demand justice,  
in the choice to break the silence,  
in the daily commitment to restore value  
to the right to be heard.  

“Cut off the King’s head”  
is not vengeance,  
but rebirth.  

It is the clean cut  
that separates power from arbitrariness,  
and returns our crown  
made of collective choices  
and shared responsibility.  

So, take the shears,  
trim away injustice,  
and with a single gesture  
rebuild a world  
where every head is free  
to look its own destiny in the eye.
